The concepts
==========================
Kadia in its core is NLP and skill management system integrated with the outer-source ASR module.


Kadia is several dockerized micro services. Thus, it will be modular and more flexible. As an additional bonus, it will make deployment easier.


The project Kadia wants to test these features:

- :ref:`Context-based skill activation system<context_based_skill_activation>`
- :ref:`Action sequence recognition<action_sequence_recognition>`
- :ref:`Text style embedding<text_style_embedding>`
- :ref:`Advanced NER<advanced_ner>`
- :ref:`The opportunity for skills to use other skills<skill_using_other_skill>`

Along with common:

- The extensible skill system
