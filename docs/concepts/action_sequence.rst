Action sequence recognition
=============================

We want to give the user an option to naturally compose script skills by saying the sequence of skills to run.

Example
-----------------------------
There are “download media” and “shut down this computer” scripts.
You want to download all GoT series at night when any noise
(including the noise of coolers) is annoying.

So, you say: “Kadia, download GoT series and shutdown”.
Kadia will ask you to confirm: “I am going to download the GoT series with a total size of 20Gb.
Then, I'll shut down this PC. Ok?“
