Embedded Skills
===========================

There are 2 types of skills: scripts and conversations. Scripts do not interact with the user.
Conversation may be interrupted for script inference.
For example, during conversation about booking a table in restaurant the user can ask Kadia about the weather.

It's our unique feature.
