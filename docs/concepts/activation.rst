Context-based skill activation system
========================================
Most of today IVA does this: “$IVA, activate $skill_name”. It’s not a natural way of communication
for users. In Kadia it’ll be like this: “Kadia, $command”, where command is the description of what to do.

Example
---------------------------------------
if there is a skill for launching nukes at the USA and you for some reason want to do it,
you can just say “bomb out the USA”.There is no need for script name memorization.
Then, if it’s important to action (such as starting a nuclear war),
Kadia will say the description of the skill, which it’s going to activate,
and will ask to confirm. Example: “You are going to launch nuclear missiles
at the US via the “Red button protocol”. Are you sure?”
