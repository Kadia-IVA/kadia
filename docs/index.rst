Kadia`s mission
================================
The main goal of the project is to test various concepts and technologies to enhance
the quality of the modern IVA industry. We aim to reach it by implementing our own
open-source Kadia using publicity-available state-of-the-art technologies. Along with the code itself,
we also want to develop standards for components of the assistant such as skills,
algorithm pattern recognition, etc..
